# Burgers

I'm a big fan of Bob's Burgers and I have no rights to anything FOX owns, I'm only trying to spread the good word for more sales for FOX. This is a burger order logger for some uniquely named burgers of the day. The app uses MySQL, NodeJS, Express, Handlebars, all wrapped in Bootstrap v4. Also includes an ORM which is new to me as well :)

# How The App Should Work

Burger Madness! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat or select already awesome creations. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be picked up and devoured. When the user clicks the pickup button, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app will store every burger in a database shown in the menu. This app is mobile responsive and was designed for both desktop and mobile throughout the project.
